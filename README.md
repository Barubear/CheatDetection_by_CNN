A project on **cheat detection**

 In recent years, new types of game cheating tools have emerged, especially a new cheating tool for FPS games that searches for characters on the game screen and automatically targets them. They are visually based and versatile, while not changing the data of the game software itself, so they can effectively avoid being detected. And with the development and popularity of artificial intelligence technology, it has become easier for individuals to develop cheating tools, facilitating the emergence of different types of cheating tools. Therefore, this paper proposes a new cheat detection method using machine learning and demonstrates that new cheating tools based on object detection can be detected by the propose method
